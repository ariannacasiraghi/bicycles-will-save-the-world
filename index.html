          <p class="center-block">Simply put, our project is a crazy feat to raise awareness that we do not necessarily need to use a car to go about our daily buisiness. Cars can be useful, and they are even essential for some of us, but <a class="green" target="_blank" href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/Transport-and-health/data-and-statistics/physical-activity2">50% of all car journeys within the EU cover less than 5 km</a>, and many of these could be undertaken on bike or foot.</p>         
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">As a reminder that transport alternatives to cars exist, we are currently cycling some 7000 km to draw the shape of a huge bicycle across 7 countries of western Europe.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">We hope that our mad endevour might inspire others to ditch their car in favour of the bicycle for daily transport needs. We do sincerely believe that bicycles can take us a long way in our battle to tackle climate change and environmental breakdown.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">As a side note, with this project we are setting an unofficial world record for the longest GPS drawing by bicycle (the current Guinnes world record is of almost 1000 km).</p>

          <p class="center-block">After selling our car, we left from Orta San Giulio (Italy) in July 2019 and we cycled some 550 km across the Swiss Alps to reach the starting point of the bicycle drawing, in the French village of Vy-lès-Lure. From there, we started tracing the bicycle shape following the directions indicated in the diagram.</p> 
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">We aimed to finish the drawing by the end of November 2019, but <a class="green" target="_blank"  href="forced-stop.html">things didn't quite go to plan</a>. We both suffered from patellofemoral pain syndrome and had to take time off cycling to do physiotherapy. Since March 2020, we were  prevented to travel due to the coronavirus lockdown measures.</p> 
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">Thus far, we covered around 5000 km of the bicycle-shaped route (in yellow). We drew <a class="green" target="_blank" href="cycling-the-down-tube.html">the down tube</a>, <a class="green" target="_blank"  href="cycling-the-fork-(twice).html">fork</a>, <a class="green" target="_blank" href="cycling-the-front-wheel-(part-1).html">front wheel</a>, <a class="green" target="_blank" href="cycling-the-handlebar.html">handlebar</a>, <a class="green" target="_blank" href="cycling-the-top-tube.html">top tube</a>, <a class="green" target="_blank" href="cycling-the-saddle.html">saddle</a>, and <a class="green" target="_blank" href="cycling-the-seat-tube.html">seat tube</a>. We still need to cycle some 2000 km in order to reach the end of the drawing, in the Belgian village of Compogne.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">Afterwards we intend to continue travelling by bike through Europe, this time following our mood rather than a set route.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">The "drawing travellers" are <a class="green" target="_blank"  href="about-us.html">Arianna, Daniel, and Zola the dog</a>. While Daniel and Zola are cycling on a custom cargo bike, Arianna is using a more standard custom tourer. Both these bikes were built by Daniel, who has recently left academia for the workshop, where he is specialising in building bespoke cargo, touring, and city bikes (see his website at: <a class="green" target="_blank"  href="https://drkcycles.com">www.drkcycles.com</a>).</p>
