          <p class="center-block">Simply put, our project is a crazy feat to raise awareness that we do not necessarily need to use a car to go about our daily buisiness. Cars can be useful, and they are even essential for some of us, but <a class="green" target="_blank" href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/Transport-and-health/data-and-statistics/physical-activity2">50% of all car journeys within the EU cover less than 5 km</a>, and many of these could be undertaken on bike or foot.</p>         
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">As a reminder that transport alternatives to cars exist, we are currently cycling some 7000 km to draw the shape of a huge bicycle across 7 countries of western Europe.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">We hope that our mad endevour might inspire others to ditch their car in favour of the bicycle for daily transport needs. We do sincerely believe that bicycles can take us a long way in our battle to tackle climate change and environmental breakdown.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="center-block">As a side note, with this project we are setting an unofficial world record for the longest GPS drawing by bicycle (the current Guinnes world record is of almost 1000 km).</p>

From there, we started tracing the bicycle shape following the directions indicated in the diagram.</p>

          <p class="center-block">We aimed to finish the drawing by the end of November 2019, but <a class="green" target="_blank"  href="forced-stop.html">things didn't quite go to plan</a>. We both suffered from patellofemoral pain syndrome and had to take time off cycling to do physiotherapy. Since March 2020, we were  prevented to travel due to the coronavirus lockdown measures.</p>
